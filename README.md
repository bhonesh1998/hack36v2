The economic growth of the country not only depends on natural resources, technology and capital but also depends on healthcare and education. Rural India is facing teacher's crisis where the post of over 1 million teachers is vacant. For sure there exist NGOs but they don't have access to proper teachers for rural areas. Keeping this in mind, we are developing a platform which minimizes the gap between the NGOs and the rural areas in terms of education factors such as teachers, books, etc. The teachers who are interested in volunteering in the educational field in rural areas can register on our app. NGOs will have the information of all the volunteers regarding a particular subject and standard. According to the requirement of class, the teacher can be selected from the list available to the NGO through our app.Based on the performance and talent of students, volunteers can provide recommendations for institutions for their higher studies. To maintain the two-way communication, there is feedback option also. 
Extra features may be added further ->
1. GPS based location of nearby.
2. API support for lecture videos.
3. Quiz option for various subjects.
